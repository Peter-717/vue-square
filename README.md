# vue-square

A example of using the [Square Payment Form](https://docs.connect.squareup.com/payments/sqpaymentform/sqpaymentform-overview) with Vue.js. Please read the full description in [**this blog post**](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/taking-payments-online-with-square-and-vue-js-39a15d2fb474). 

To try it out, first clone the repo and then run `npm run dev` to start up the development server. 

This example was made with the [`vue-cli`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli), so most of the boilerplate is from the default 'webpack' project.
